# swiss-army-knife v2

Packing any application with a tiny/bare minimal base image sounds like an awesome/cool/intelligent idea, until things break and there are no tools inside the container to debug the problem at hand.  
This repo/docker image solves this problem by providing a robust image equipped with a wide array of tools needed to debug the majority of issues in production environments.  

This image also includes a very small web application for testing/debugging purposes.

## Running

### Using Docker

```bash
# Run and attach to the network namespace of the container to debug
docker run --name swiss-army-knife --net=container:${CONTAINER_ID_TO_DEBUG} -itd ranchersupport/swiss-army-knife-v2

# Exec into the tools container
docker exec -it swiss-army-knife bash

# Show off your ninja skill!
tcpdump -i eth0 -vvv -nn -s0 -SS -XX
```

### Using Containerd

```bash
# Find the target container's PID
TARGET_CONTAINER_ID=<TARGET_CONTAINER_ID>
TARGET_CONTAINER_PID=$(crictl inspect --output go-template --template '{{.info.pid}}' $TARGET_CONTAINER_ID)

# Run swiss-army-knife and attach to the target container's network namespace
ctr run --rm --privileged \
    --mount type=bind,src=/proc/${TARGET_CONTAINER_PID}/ns/net,dst=/proc/self/ns/net,options=rbind:ro \
    ranchersupport/swiss-army-knife-v2 swiss-army-knife bash
```

## Use Cases

1. **Debugging Network Issues**:
   - Use tools like `tcpdump`, `dig`, and `nslookup` to debug DNS and network traffic.
   
2. **Testing Web Applications**:
   - Use `curl`, `wget`, or `telnet` to test service availability.

3. **Kubernetes Troubleshooting**:
   - Multiple versions of `kubectl` are included for compatibility with different Kubernetes clusters.

4. **System Debugging**:
